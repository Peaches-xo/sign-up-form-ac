### **Goals** 
Create a functional sign up form using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

- provide client side validation of form fields 
- use git to manage version control
- use Grid for layout & structuring

### **Positives**
- Implemented scrolling "marquee" effect with 'prefers-reduced-motion' media query
- Used min-width on the clipboard to ensure paper doesnt overflow clipboard
- Added font and banner reminiscent of Animal Crossing: New Horizon design styles
- Added music player & github link

### **Challenges:**
- Originally used Regex to match dates for star sign DOB validation. Added some string methods & comparison to be able to increase readability.


### **To Look Into:**
- image maps for links. Would have liked to link my github to the yellow badge on the shirt.
